# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a decentralized portfolio platform that enables users to select professionally designed portfolio templates, fork them to their own GitHub accounts, and customize them using an intuitive web editor. The platform maintains user sovereignty over their code and data while providing seamless editing capabilities and live hosting at personalized URLs.

## Requirements

2. WHEN a user views a template THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the template design
3. WHEN a user selects a template THEN the system SHALL provide template details and fork option
4. IF a template is unavailable THEN the system SHALL indicate the status and suggest alternatives

### Requirement 3: Repository Forking Process

**User Story:** As a user, I want to fork a selected template to my GitHub account so that I own the complete source code and content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a template to fork THEN the system SHALL use GitHub REST API to fork the repository
2. WHEN forking is initiated THEN the system SHALL fork the template repository to the user's GitHub account
3. WHEN forking completes THEN the system SHALL verify the fork was created successfully
4. IF forking fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and suggest troubleshooting steps
5. WHEN fork is successful THEN the system SHALL redirect the user to the web editor

### Requirement 4: Repository Structure Analysis

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web editor to automatically understand my portfolio structure so that I can edit content without technical knowledge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the editor THEN the system SHALL analyze the forked repository structure
2. WHEN analyzing structure THEN the system SHALL identify content files (data.json, markdown files, etc.)
3. WHEN structure is identified THEN the system SHALL present an appropriate editing interface
4. IF structure cannot be determined THEN the system SHALL provide guidance on supported formats

### Requirement 5: Web-Based Content Editing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to edit my portfolio content through a web interface so that I can customize my portfolio without using command line tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the editor THEN the system SHALL display current portfolio content in editable form
2. WHEN a user modifies content THEN the system SHALL validate changes in real-time
3. WHEN a user saves changes THEN the system SHALL commit and push updates to their GitHub repository
4. WHEN changes are saved THEN the system SHALL provide confirmation of successful update
5. IF save fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and allow retry

### Requirement 6: Live Portfolio Hosting

**User Story:** As a user, I want my portfolio to be automatically hosted at a decentralized URL that directly maps to my GitHub repository so that I can share it with others immediately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user's portfolio is updated THEN the system SHALL serve the latest content at nebula-mu-henna.vercel.app/[githubusername]/[reponame]
2. WHEN someone visits nebula-mu-henna.vercel.app/[githubusername]/[reponame] THEN the system SHALL render the portfolio dynamically from the specified GitHub repository
3. WHEN content is fetched THEN the system SHALL retrieve files directly from the user's GitHub repository using the URL parameters
4. WHEN the repository structure is valid THEN the system SHALL render the portfolio using the appropriate template
5. IF the GitHub repository is unavailable or private THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate error page
6. IF the repository doesn't contain a valid portfolio structure THEN the system SHALL display a helpful error message

### Requirement 7: Decentralized URL Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want my portfolio to be accessible through a direct GitHub repository mapping so that the URL structure is transparent and fully decentralized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN someone accesses nebula-mu-henna.vercel.app/[githubusername]/[reponame] THEN the system SHALL validate the GitHub username and repository name
2. WHEN the URL parameters are valid THEN the system SHALL fetch content directly from the specified GitHub repository
3. WHEN the repository exists and is public THEN the system SHALL render the portfolio content
4. WHEN the repository contains multiple portfolio templates THEN the system SHALL use the default or specified template
5. IF the GitHub username doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a "user not found" error
6. IF the repository doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL display a "repository not found" error
7. IF the repository is private THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate access error

### Requirement 8: Template Compatibility and Standards

**User Story:** As a template creator, I want to follow consistent standards so that my templates work seamlessly with the platform's editor.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a template is created THEN it SHALL follow the platform's structural conventions
2. WHEN the editor processes a template THEN it SHALL locate content files using standard patterns
3. WHEN content is edited THEN the template SHALL render correctly with updated content
4. IF template structure is invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to template creators

### Requirement 9: Error Handling and Recovery

**User Story:** As a user, I want clear error messages and recovery options when something goes wrong so that I can resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN GitHub API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages
2. WHEN repository access is denied THEN the system SHALL guide users through permission resolution
3. WHEN commits fail THEN the system SHALL preserve user changes and allow retry
4. WHEN the platform experiences issues THEN users SHALL retain full access to their GitHub repositories

### Requirement 10: Repository Synchronization and Conflict Resolution

**User Story:** As a user, I want the web editor to handle external changes to my repository so that I don't lose work when editing through multiple channels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the editor THEN the system SHALL check if the remote repository has newer commits
2. WHEN the remote repository is ahead THEN the system SHALL update the editor content and notify the user
3. WHEN a user attempts to save changes THEN the system SHALL verify the repository hasn't been updated externally
4. IF external changes exist during save THEN the system SHALL prevent overwriting and prompt user to refresh
5. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the system SHALL preserve unsaved work and provide clear resolution options
6. WHEN user refreshes after conflicts THEN the system SHALL load the latest repository state

### Requirement 11: Performance and Scalability

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN portfolios are accessed THEN the system SHALL load content within 2 seconds
2. WHEN multiple users edit simultaneously THEN the system SHALL handle concurrent operations
3. WHEN GitHub API rate limits are approached THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling
4. WHEN system load increases THEN performance SHALL remain consistent
