  - `src/app/api/auth/logout/route.js` (active editor)
  - `src/app/api/auth/config/route.js`
  - `.kiro/specs/decentralized-portfolio-platform/tasks.md`
  - `Process.md`
- **Status**: Authentication system maintenance - fixing import paths to ensure proper module resolution
- **Notes**: This fix ensures the logout route can properly access the session clearing functionality from the github-auth library. The extra `../` was needed due to the nested directory structure of the auth API routes.

### Tasks Specification Status Update
- **Time**: Earlier in current session
- **File Modified**: `.kiro/specs/decentralized-portfolio-platform/tasks.md`
- **Change Type**: Task status correction
- **Change Details**: Changed task 5.3 "Implement template compatibility validation" from `[-]` (in progress) to `[ ]` (not started) and added blank line for formatting
- **Context**: Correcting task status to accurately reflect current implementation state
- **Active Files**: 
  - `.kiro/specs/decentralized-portfolio-platform/tasks.md` (active editor)
  - `Process.md` (active editor)
- **Status**: Project continues with completed authentication system and repository service layer. Tasks 1-4 are marked complete, with focus now on template analysis system (Task 5) and UI components (Task 6).
- **Notes**: Status correction indicates that template compatibility validation work has not yet begun, providing more accurate project tracking.
